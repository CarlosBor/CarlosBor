# Carlos

🚀 I'm an enthusiastic web developer with a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly web applications. I've built a versatile skill set and a strong commitment to self-improvement. I like solving problems.

💡 After working abroad, I have also developed a few passion projects myself, a proof of my desire to explore trends in web development and to tackle new challenges, learning from doing.

👨‍💻 I see myself as a born self-learner, which I consider essential for software development, where staying current is a requirement, and my skillset, ranging from CMS usage to the standard HTML5 stack, makes me a competent developer.
